## What is VigVinnie?

**@VigVinnie** combines AIGG's technical capabilities with an authentic Brooklyn bookmaker personality. Users mention @VigVinnie with market questions and get actionable trading insights in seconds.

### The Character
- **Personality**: Italian-American Brooklyn bookmaker with street-smart betting wisdom
- **Voice**: Uses gambling terminology ("the line's wobbling", "smart money's drifting")
- **Style**: Direct, opinionated analysis with confidence percentages
- **Avatar**: Pepe profile picture that's become iconic in prediction markets

2. **Analysis**: Get Brooklyn bookmaker-style analysis with current context
3. **Action**: Receive clear BUY/SELL/HOLD with confidence score
4. **Trade**: Direct Polymarket link for immediate action

## Example Interaction

**User:** "@VigVinnie NYC mayoral election thoughts?"

**VigVinnie's Response:**
> Word is Mamdani's pulling early traction with 26%-50% in the books, and the line's wobbling. Adams and Cuomo split the Dem vote, so the smart money's drifting toward the progressive yes side. With debates near and the juice shifting, there's value before the late action hits.

**Follow-up Tweet with Link:**
> https://polymarket.com/event/nyc-mayor-2025

This two-tweet pattern delivers both analysis and market access.
