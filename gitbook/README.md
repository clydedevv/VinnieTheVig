# AIGG - A Polymarket Companion

## Introduction

AIGG powers intelligent prediction market analysis. The system lets anyone ask a market question on Twitter and get a concise answer they can act on: a one-paragraph rationale, a clear BUY/SELL/HOLD with confidence, and the exact Polymarket link.

## The Problem We're Tackling

Prediction markets are having a moment. Crypto Twitter and mainstream outlets are paying attention, especially when volatility spikes. But attention and capital are scattered across thousands of tokens and feeds.

- Discovery is noisy
- Naming is inconsistent
- Timing matters

Most people either can't find the right market quickly or don't have the time to research it. Generic bots make this worse by producing vague text that doesn't help you trade.

## Meet VigVinnie

With AIGG as the backend, **@VigVinnie** is the character who brings it to life on Twitter. VigVinnie is an Italian-American Brooklyn bookmaker with a Pepe profile picture who talks like he's been taking bets his whole life.

**Follow VigVinnie:** [@VigVinnie](https://x.com/VigVinnie)

### The Character
- **Personality**: Brooklyn bookmaker with old-school betting parlor wisdom
- **Voice**: Uses gambling terminology ("the line's wobbling", "smart money's drifting")  
- **Background**: Italian-American who knows the streets and the books
- **Style**: Direct, opinionated, and always ready with a take

### How It Works
Mention @VigVinnie with any market question and he does the heavy lifting: identifies the correct market, adds current context when needed, and replies with a short, opinionated take and confidence number, plus the official Polymarket link.

- If you have domain expertise, VigVinnie accelerates you
- If you don't, he gives you a usable starting point instead of sending you down a research rabbit hole

## Example Interaction

Here's how VigVinnie responds to market questions:

**User:** "@VigVinnie NYC mayoral election thoughts?"

**VigVinnie's Analysis Tweet:**
> Word is Mamdani's pulling early traction with 26%-50% in the books, and the line's wobbling. Adams and Cuomo split the Dem vote, so the smart money's drifting toward the progressive yes side. With debates near and the juice shifting, there's value before the late action hits.

**VigVinnie's Follow-up Tweet:**
> See the actual tweet: https://x.com/VigVinnie/status/1972204104253350057
