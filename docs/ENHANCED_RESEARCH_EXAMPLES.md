# Enhanced Perplexity Research Examples

## Overview
The enhanced research system extracts topics from prediction markets and researches them WITHOUT revealing they're for predictions. This prevents biased results and gets better information.

## Example Transformations

### 1. Bitcoin Market
**Market Question**: "Will Bitcoin reach $200,000 by end of 2025?"

**Extracted Topic**: "Bitcoin price trends and factors influencing valuation"

**Key Aspects**: "Historical price performance, institutional adoption, macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, halving events, market sentiment, and on-chain activity"

**What Perplexity Searches For**:
- Current Bitcoin price and recent movements
- Institutional investment trends (MicroStrategy, ETFs, etc.)
- Regulatory developments globally
- Technical analysis patterns
- Macroeconomic factors affecting crypto
- On-chain metrics (hash rate, active addresses, etc.)

### 2. Geopolitical Market
**Market Question**: "Will China invade Taiwan before 2026?"

**Extracted Topic**: "China-Taiwan relations and geopolitical tensions in the Taiwan Strait"

**Key Aspects**: "Military posturing, diplomatic developments, cross-strait relations, economic ties, government statements, regional security"

**What Perplexity Searches For**:
- Recent military exercises or movements
- Diplomatic statements from both sides
- US and regional ally responses
- Economic interdependence data
- Historical context of tensions
- Expert analysis on escalation risks

### 3. Economic Market
**Market Question**: "Will the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in March 2025?"

**Extracted Topic**: "Federal Reserve monetary policy and interest rate decision factors"

**Key Aspects**: "Inflation trends, labor market conditions, GDP growth, FOMC statements, economic projections"

**What Perplexity Searches For**:
- Latest inflation data (CPI, PCE)
- Employment statistics
- Fed official speeches and hints
- Market expectations (Fed funds futures)
- Economic growth indicators
- Global economic conditions

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Unbiased Information**: Perplexity doesn't know it's researching for prediction markets, so it provides neutral information

2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: We get actual news, data, and expert opinions rather than prediction-focused content

3. **Better Signal**: The research focuses on fundamentals rather than speculation

4. **Structured Output**: We get specific sections (current situation, key data, upcoming catalysts) that directly inform trading decisions
