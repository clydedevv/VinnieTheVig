# Repository Cleanup Summary

## High Priority Tasks Completed (Non-Breaking)

### 1. ✅ Created Organized Test Structure
- Created `tests/` directory with `unit/` and `integration/` subdirectories
- Added proper `__init__.py` files for Python package structure

### 2. ✅ Updated .gitignore
Added the following entries to prevent future tracking of:
- `logs/` directory and all `*.log` files
- Test output files (`test_results_*.json`)
- Environment files (`api/.env`)
- Output directories (`api/output_logs/`)
- IDE files (`.vscode/`, `.idea/`)
- Claude AI settings (`.claude/`)

### 3. ✅ Moved All Test Files
Successfully moved 10 test files from root to organized structure:
- **Unit Tests** (2 files):
  - `test_llm_market_matching.py`
  - `test_market_matching_standalone.py`
- **Integration Tests** (8 files):
  - `test_internal.py`
  - `test_market_improvements.py`
  - `test_market_matching_fixes.py`
  - `test_market_matching_real.py`
  - `test_response_improvement.py`
  - `test_twitter_improvements.py`
  - `test_basic_pipeline.py`
  - `test_pipeline_2025_queries.py`

### 4. ✅ Removed Files from Git Tracking
- Removed all log files from git (5 files in `logs/` + 1 in root)
- Deleted test output JSON files (2 files)
- These files will no longer be tracked in version control

### 5. ✅ Organized Other Files
- Moved `vinnie.json` to `config/personas/` (appears to be a bot persona config)

## Import Updates Made
- Updated `test_llm_market_matching.py` to use relative imports
- Updated `test_market_improvements.py` to properly import from new test structure

## Verification
- ✅ Verified `main.py` still works correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes introduced
- ✅ All files properly moved using `git mv` to maintain history

## Important Architectural Note
The codebase currently has two flow implementations:
- `enhanced_aigg_flow.py` - Original flow (still used in main.py for tests)
- `dspy_enhanced_aigg_flow.py` - New DSPy-enhanced flow with LLM market matching

Consider updating `main.py` to use the DSPy-enhanced flow consistently if that's the intended production version.

## Next Steps (Medium Priority)
Based on CLEANUP_REPO.MD, the next tasks would be:
1. Consolidate migration documents
2. Reorganize documentation structure
3. Move utility scripts to `scripts/` directory
4. Investigate and clean up unclear files like `langsearch/` directory
5. Update main.py imports to use consistent flow implementation

## Git Status
All changes are staged and ready to commit. The repository is now cleaner with:
- Organized test structure
- No log files in version control
- Better .gitignore coverage
- Cleaner root directory
